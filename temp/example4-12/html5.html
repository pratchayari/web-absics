        HTML5 will be the new standard for HTML. 
        The previous version of HTML, HTML 4.01, 
        came in 1999. The web has changed a lot since then. 
        HTML5 is still a work in progress. However, 
        the major browsers support many of the 
        new HTML5 elements and APIs...
